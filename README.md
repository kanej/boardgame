C# Coding Challenge

The VS solution is at the root of this repo. There are two projects, the core game and its logic:

```
  ./Src/BoardGame/BoardGame.csproj
```

And an accompanying test projct:

```
 .Test/BoardGameTests/BoardGameTests.csproj
```
The console app can be run and the tests are in MSTest, so run all tests in solution should work.
